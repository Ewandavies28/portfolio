    <h1 class="abouttitle">About...</h1><br>
    <p class="abouttext">The above is a website that will allow you play a virutal drum kit by either clicking the buttons on screen or pressing the corrosponding buttons on your keyboard.</p><br>
    <p class="abouttext">The creation of the site was achived by using html buttons and then using event listener's added with Javascript, to add the event listeners to each of the buttons an for loop was created which applies the event listener to any html element that has a class that contain's ".drum". This makes it so that if needed I will be able to add additional buttons to the site without having to write specific code for each HTML element.</p><br>
    <p class="abouttext">The event listener is then used in combination with a varible to pick up which button was pressed by looking at the innerHTML of the pressed button which contains the letter that corresponds with the button, once pressed another function is run which uses a switch statement to play the correct sound based on the button pressed.</p><br>
    <p class="abouttext">A similair process was used for the keyboard press however this time we used the keyboard event and looked for the .key from the event which tells us what key was pressed and then plays the according sound using the same switch statement that was previously used.</p><br>
    <p class="abouttext">Have a go!</p>
